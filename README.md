# vimspector - A multi language debugger for Vim

# Status

The plugin is a capable, if basic, debugger for c++ and python on the author's
computer. I think the concept is well and truly proven and it is worth
completing.

If you are insanely curious and wish to try it out, it's probably best to find
me in #vim or the YCM gitter channel. It's probably too early.

In order to use it you have to currently:

- Write an undocumented configuration file that contains essentially
  undocumented parameters.
- Use an undocumented API via things like `:call vimsepctor#Launch()`.
- etc.

# Background

The motivation is that debugging in Vim is a pretty horrible experience,
particularly if you use multiple languages. With pyclewn no more and the
built-in termdebug plugin limited to gdb, I wanted to explore options.

While Language Server Protocol is well known, the Debug Adapter Protocol is less
well known, but achieves a similar goal: language agnostic API abstracting
debuggers from clients.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple but effective debugging
experience in Vim for multiple languages, by leveraging the debug adapters that
are being built for Visual Studio Code.

The ability to do remote debugging is a must. This is key to my workflow, so
baking it in to the debugging experience is a top bill goal for the project.

# Features and Usage

## Launch and attach by PID:

* Create `vimspector.json`. See [below](#supported-languages).
* `:call vimsepctor#Launch()` and select a configuration.

## Breakpoints

* Use `vimspector#ToggleBreakpoint()` to set/disable/delete a line breakpoint.
* Use `vimspector#AddFunctionBreakpoint( '<name>' )` to add a function
breakpoint.

## Stepping

* Step in/out, finish, continue, pause etc. using the WinBar.
* If you really want to, the API is `vimspector#StepInto()` etc.

## Variables and scopes

* Current scope shows values of locals.
* Use `<CR>` to expand/collapse (+, -).
* When changing the stack frame the locals window updates.

## Watches

* Add watches to the variables window with
`:call vimspector#AddWatch( '<expr>' )`
* Expand result with `<CR>`.
* Delete with `<DEL>`.

## Stack Trraces

* In the threads window, use `<CR>` to expand/collapse.
* Use `<CR>` on a stack frame to jump to it.

## Program Output:

* In the outputs window use the WinBar to select the output channel.
* The debugee prints to the stdout channel.
* Other channels may be useful for debugging.

# Supported Languages

Current tested with the following debug adapters.

Note, there is no support for installing the extension. Use VSCode to do that by
installing it in the UI. The default extension directory is something like
`$HOME/.vscode/extensions`.

Note, the launch configurations below are reverse-engineered from the
extensions. Typically they are documented in the extension's `package.json`, but
not always (or not completely).

Also the mock debugger, but that isn't actually useful.

# Unsupported

Known not to work:

* CodeLLDB. This doesn't work because it requires unique logic to launch the
  server, and it uses TCP/IP rather than standard streams.
* Java Debug Server. This doesn't work (yet) because it runs as a jdt.ls plugin.
  Support for this may be added in conjunction with [ycmd][], but this
  architecture is incredibly complex and vastly different from any other.
* C-sharp. The license appears to require that it is only used with Visual
  Studio Code.

# FAQ

1. Q: Does it work? A: Yeah, sort of. It's _incredibly_ buggy and unpolished.
2. Q: Does it work with <insert language here>? A: Probably, but it won't
   necessarily be easy to work out what to put in the `.vimspector.json`. As you
   can see above, some of the servers aren't really editor agnostic, and require
   very-specific unique handling.
