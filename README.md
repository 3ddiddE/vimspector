# vimspector - A multi language debugger for Vim

# Status

This is a work in progress. It barely functions.

# About

The motivation is that debugging in Vim is a pretty horrible experience,
particularly if you use multiple languages. With pyclewn no more and the
built-in termdebug plugin limited to gdb, I wanted to explore options.

While Language Server Protocol is well known, the Debug Adapter Protocol is less
well known, but achieves a similar goal: language agnostic API abstracting
debuggers from clients.

The aim of this project is to provide a simple but effective debugging
experience in Vim for multiple languages, by leveraging the debug adapters that
are being built for VScode.

The ability to do remote debugging is a must. This is key to my workflow, so
baking it in to the debugging experience is a top bill goal for the project.

# Demo

Well there is a proof of concept, showing some of the features and the use of
different debug adapters and languages (c++ and Python):

Yes, it's buggy right now, and the UI is all placeholder, but it shows that
there is some potential, I think.
